## Movie Recommendation System

### Description

This project explores the similarities and differences in people's tastes in movies based on how they rate different movies to how understanding these ratings contribute to a movie recommendation system for users.

### Install

This project implemented using **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries:

- [Jupyter Notebook (IPython) 4.10.0](https://ipython.org/)
- [NumPy 1.16.4](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas 0.24.0](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib 2.2.4](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn 0.19.2](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Code

The code is provided in the `movie-recommendation-system.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `helper.py` Python file and the dataset files inside ml-latest-small folder to successfully compile the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `movie-recommendation-system/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython movie-recommendation-syste.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter movie-recommendation-syste.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
The data for this project comes from the wonderful [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) [user rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). We'll be looking at individual movie ratings later in the notebook, but let us start with how ratings of genres compare to each other.
